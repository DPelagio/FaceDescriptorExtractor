# FaceDescriptorExtractor
Modulo 3 para el reconocimiento facial
This module will provide functions to extract and compare vectorial descriptors of faces.
CLASS

Constructor
  The constructor by default will provide a path to the model already trained that will be used to obtain the face descriptors.
  You can also load the class providing a different path in a string, that contains the file of the model.
  
Functions
  1. obtenerDescriptorVectorial(cv::Mat given) : this function will return a cv::Mat that contains the vectorial descriptor that
  represents the face given.
        cv::Mat given - this Mat contains the image that we will analize and obtain the vectorial descriptors.
        cv::Mat result - this Mat contains the descriptors of the Mat given and we return it.
        
  2. compararDescriptores(cv::Mat 1, cv::Mat 2) : this function returns a boolean according to the euclidean distance and the
  threshold that we set which is 0.6.
        cv::Mat 1 - contains the descriptors that will be compared against Mat 2.
        cv::Mat 2 - "                                                     " Mat 1.
        boolean - we return true if they are close enough to be lower than the threshold or false if they are too distant in 
        order to be higher than the threshold.
